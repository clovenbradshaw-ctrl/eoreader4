// THE ONE SURPRISE — the modality-agnostic core (Track A, docs/spec-one-surprise.md).
//
// There is exactly one surprise: D_KL(posterior ‖ prior) over a γ-decayed referent
// profile in a fixed basis. The profile is the BACKWARD object — the γ-decayed summary
// of what has arrived; the posterior is that profile advanced one step (every incumbent
// decays by γ, every atom delivered this step deposits γ⁰ = 1). A fixed NOVELTY reserve
// atom keeps the divergence defined on a newcomer (absolute continuity) and makes an
// opening fall to exactly zero on its own.
//
// This is the form `reading.js` already computed for the text Bayesian-surprise channel,
// lifted out verbatim so it is the ONLY form. The only modality-specific code is the
// FRONT-END map from raw signal into the basis: `prior` and `arrival` are Maps from a
// basis-atom (an arbitrary key — a proposition for text, a tonal move for music, a cell
// for the phasepost path) to a mass, and `axisLabel` renders an atom to a readable strain
// axis. Everything here — the posterior, the divergence, the reserve, the per-dimension
// contribution — is shared.
//
// Operations and their ORDER are preserved exactly from reading.js so the text path stays
// byte-identical: the parity gate is `node --test tests/*.test.js` (docs/spec-one-surprise.md).

// atom (`reserve`). Σ p(dist) + reserve = 1.

// two uses. It is exposed here for the DRAW (the generator's first act, Part II) and as the
// honest forward object the recognition core can already turn around into. It is NOT yet
// wired into the predictive SCORE — today's surprisal is an ad-hoc floored mean, not
// −log₂ p(arrival) under this distribution; adopting this for scoring changes the surprisal
// and ships behind RULES_REV with a parallel golden (the deferred Track A step).

// THE NOVELTY RESERVE AS A SIGNAL, not a constant.
//
// NOVELTY_RESERVE is a hand-rolled literal, and the reserve PROBABILITY it produces,
// `novelty / (mass + novelty)`, is a one-over-mass-plus-one — a function of accumulated
// mass alone, blind to whether newcomers have actually been ARRIVING. So the reader
// grows equally certain that nothing new will come whether it just saw six newcomers in
// a row or none: it cannot learn the newcomer rate from its own signal, which for a
// system with no teacher is the cardinal error (a fixed number standing in for something
// the signal should teach).
//
// This derives the reserve AMPLITUDE from the signal's own recent history instead: the
// γ-decayed rate at which the basis has been admitting FIRST appearances, under the SAME
// recency kernel the figure/proposition field decays by. High right after a burst of
// newcomers, low after a long stretch of confirmation. The amplitude is then fed through
// the SAME fixed Born step — `surpriseAt` and `forwardDist` already take it as `novelty`,
// so the law (square-and-normalise the amplitude into a probability) is untouched and
// only the amplitude is now context-sensitive. Context enters at the amplitude; the law
// stays put.
//
// Atom-agnostic by construction: it counts first appearances of arbitrary basis keys, so
// a text figure, a tonal pitch and an image blob run IDENTICAL code. That is what lets
// the same fix improve more than one sense — the interior's universality claim — rather
// than being a text fact in an interior costume.
//
//   arrivalSets  Array<Iterable<atom>>  the deposit at each PRIOR step, in reading order
//                (causal: step k sees only steps 0..k-1)
//   gamma        the same recency kernel the profile decays by (the horizon)
// Returns R = Σ_s γ^((k-1)-s) · (newcomers first admitted at step s) — the reserve
// amplitude. It is strictly positive once any atom has been admitted, so the divergence
// stays defined on a newcomer (absolute continuity); only the empty opening gives 0,
// where the surprise is already 0 for any reserve and the caller keeps the constant.
