// THE ONE SURPRISE — the modality-agnostic core (Track A, docs/spec-one-surprise.md).
//
// There is exactly one surprise: D_KL(posterior ‖ prior) over a γ-decayed referent
// profile in a fixed basis. The profile is the BACKWARD object — the γ-decayed summary
// of what has arrived; the posterior is that profile advanced one step (every incumbent
// decays by γ, every atom delivered this step deposits γ⁰ = 1). A fixed NOVELTY reserve
// atom keeps the divergence defined on a newcomer (absolute continuity) and makes an
// opening fall to exactly zero on its own.
//
// This is the form `reading.js` already computed for the text Bayesian-surprise channel,
// lifted out verbatim so it is the ONLY form. The only modality-specific code is the
// FRONT-END map from raw signal into the basis: `prior` and `arrival` are Maps from a
// basis-atom (an arbitrary key — a proposition for text, a tonal move for music, a cell
// for the phasepost path) to a mass, and `axisLabel` renders an atom to a readable strain
// axis. Everything here — the posterior, the divergence, the reserve, the per-dimension
// contribution — is shared.
//
// Operations and their ORDER are preserved exactly from reading.js so the text path stays
// byte-identical: the parity gate is `node --test tests/*.test.js` (docs/spec-one-surprise.md).

// atom (`reserve`). Σ p(dist) + reserve = 1.
//
// "Reading scores the arrival under p(next); generation draws from p(next)." Same object,
// two uses. It is exposed here for the DRAW (the generator's first act, Part II) and as the
// honest forward object the recognition core can already turn around into. It is NOT yet
// wired into the predictive SCORE — today's surprisal is an ad-hoc floored mean, not
// −log₂ p(arrival) under this distribution; adopting this for scoring changes the surprisal
// and ships behind RULES_REV with a parallel golden (the deferred Track A step).

// THE SIGNAL-DERIVED NOVELTY RESERVE — the constant hunt's fix, on the exemplar.
//
// A hand-set reserve (NOVELTY_RESERVE = 1.0) is blind to whether newcomers have
// been arriving: the reader grows equally certain that nothing new will come
// whether it just saw three newcomers or none. That is the reader failing to learn
// from its own signal — an external assumption standing in for something the signal
// should teach.
//
// The fix is not a better formula; it is to make the reserved AMPLITUDE track the
// recent novelty RATE under the SAME decay the figure field uses, then run it
// through the SAME fixed Born step (surpriseAt / forwardDist, unchanged). Context
// enters at the amplitude; the law stays put. Each atom first seen at step `f` is
// one newcomer-event of weight γ^(at-1-f); their sum is the protention the reader
// reserves for the as-yet-unseen — high right after a burst of newcomers, decaying
// toward zero through a stretch of pure confirmation. It is strictly positive
// whenever any atom has been seen (a non-empty prior always carries ≥ one newcomer),
// and zero only at the opening, where surprise is zero regardless.
//
// Modality-agnostic — it reads only step indices and γ, never a token, pitch, or
// pixel. Every sense's front-end feeds it the same first-seen steps, so the same
// fixed law turns a context-sensitive amplitude into a context-sensitive belief for
// every sense alike. This is the interior; the membrane stays the line.
